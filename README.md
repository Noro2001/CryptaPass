## 🧐 How It Works

- All data is encrypted using Fernet (AES-based symmetric encryption)
- A key is saved in `key.key` (auto-generated if missing)
- Passwords are securely written to `passwords.enc`
- You can view, generate, and export passwords from the UI

---

## 🔒 Security Tips

- Keep `key.key` safe — it's required to decrypt your data!
- `passwords.enc` is encrypted and can be safely stored
- **Do NOT upload** `key.key` or `passwords.enc` to GitHub
- Always add sensitive files to `.gitignore`
